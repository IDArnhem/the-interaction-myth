# The Computer is not a tool, it is the thing that is eating your tools

For every _Adobe Illustrator_ there is a dead _Freehand_.
The software industry has a general tendency toward consolidation and the progressive build up of monopolies. There is very little diversity in the area of general purpose tools. From the search engine to the vector drawing software the number of choices available to us are often few.

# Digital fabrication

I used to say that digital fabrication was mostly for people that didn't know how to craft things in any other way. I no longer think that, but I tend to resist that facile enthusiasm that has come to characterize people frequenting FabLabs the world over. An architect friend of mine insists that you can do things with digital fabrication that you cannot with manual crafting techniques, to which I would reply that the converse is also true, there are things you can craft by hand that you cannot craft digitally. This deadlock situation has never really been resolved in either direction and we both have yet to find examples of this uniqueness that we claim for each of the processes that we defend.

(@3D bioprinting? it is now possible to 3D print a replica of a bone that is almost exactly like the original and has identical weight distribution and do this in biocompatible materials, research shows that it is possible to print bone matter as well)

At first we thought that perhaps 3D printing fractals would be something that you can't possibly craft by hand, but then found counter examples in certain chemical manufacturing processes that produce crystal structures.

## Thought exercise

thesis: Digital modeling and manufacturing processes detach us from the material cultures that gave us the tools that ultimately gave us the objects that we are now crafting digitally.

Imagine a metal or wood workshop in which every single tool performs its
affordances in two different realms, the physical, just like they would normally do
and the digital. That means that using the lathe in our hypothetical metal workshop would result in both, a physical object (a metallic revolution surface) and a down-to-the-micron precise 3D model of the object that we just crafted by hand. In a way this workshop would be the inverse of 3D printing.

By this I do not mean that our lathe acts as a 3D scanner. 3D scanning is an imprecise translation from the physical to the digital that often requires manual post-processing (cleaning the mesh, patching the holes, adjusting mesh complexity, etc) and it hardy has millimeter precision, let alone micron precision.

Think about every tool in our hypothetical workshop having this dual affordance and that this is our new normal. A single physical manufacturing process resulting in two objects that exist in two worlds, the material and the digital world.

From the lathe, to the hand-saw, to the drill, every tool in our workshop has this dual function. We make a hole in our aluminum plate, that hole automatically appears in our 3D model in exactly the right place.

@What happens to interactivity or mechanical properties? (we should be able to always drop to code in the digital realm)
@Revision control: what happens when a change occurs in the digital realm how does it propagate to the physical? (Do I need to answer this question?)
